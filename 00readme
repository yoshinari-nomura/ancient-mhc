** DESCRIPTION:

MHC is designed to help those who receive most appointments via email.
Using MHC, you can easily import schedule articles from emails.

You can get the latest version from:
 http://www.quickhack.net/mhc/

MHC has following features:

+ Simple data structure allows you to manipulate stored data in many ways.
+ Both UNIX and Windows9x support.
+ Appointments can be made to repeat in flexible ways.
+ powerful but simple expression of appointments.
  Each appointment can have following attributes:

    date, subject, start/end time (not mandatory),
    advance time of alarm,
    multiple categories,
    repetition rules,
    duration of the repetition,
    list of exception dates,
    list of extra dates
    description and email which originated the appointment.

+ Multiple User Interface such as commandline/emacs/GUI/Web.
  MHC currently has following interfaces:

    + Elisp package cooperative with  Mew, Wanderlust or Gnus
        (popular MUA in the Emacs world)
        (emacs/mhc.el)
    + GUI (Ruby/Gtk based) desktop calendar application. (gemcal)
    + CGI based Web interface 
        (not in this package please see http://mhc.hauN.org/web-mhc/)
    + Command line schedule lister like the scan of MH. (mscan)

MHC stores schedule articles in the same form of MH; you can manipulate
these messages not only by above tools but also by many other MUAs,
editors, UNIX commandline tools or your own scripts.
