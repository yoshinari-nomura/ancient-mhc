    In the previous version of mhc, the location for
    schedule repository was fixed at ~/Mail/schedule/ and 
    .schedule. Now, you can change it.

*** Faces in a summary buffer are now customizable.
    (mhc-category-face-alist, mhc-symbol-face-alist)

*** Some keybinds are changes. (C-c> , C-c<)
    2 keybinds C-c> and C-c< are changed to C-cp and C-cn,
    not to violate the minor-mode convention.

*** mhc-import by C-c| becomes more convenient.
    In case you import an article which already has X-SC-*: fields, 
    mhc uses these values as defaults.

*** M-p and M-n become wiser.
    mhc becomes to have its own history alists.

    you can newly use `-' like: 5/15-17.

** Changes in other tools.

    schedule item, because of some problems of ruby-gtk for windows.
