;;; Commentary:

;; This file is a part of MHC, includes functions for draft.

;;; About MUA Backend:

;; In order to define new MUA backend, it is required to define these
;; methods.
;;
;;     (mhc-foo-draft-setup-new)
;;         Setup new draft (Insert header separator).
;;
;;     (mhc-foo-draft-reedit-buffer BUFFER ORIGINAL)
;;         Restore content of BUFFER as draft in the current buffer.
;;         If ORIGINAL is non-nil, use BUFFER as raw buffer.
;;
;;     (mhc-foo-draft-reedit-file FILENAME)
;;         Restore contents of file FILENAME as draft in the current buffer.
;; 
;;     (mhc-foo-draft-translate)
;;         Translate current buffer to raw buffer.
;;
;; Define these methods appropriately, and put definitions as follows:
;;
;;    (put 'mhc-foo 'draft-setup-new 'mhc-foo-draft-setup-new)
;;    (put 'mhc-foo 'draft-reedit-buffer 'mhc-foo-draft-reedit-buffer)
;;    (put 'mhc-foo 'draft-reedit-file 'mhc-foo-draft-reedit-file)
;;    (put 'mhc-foo 'draft-translate 'mhc-foo-draft-translate)
